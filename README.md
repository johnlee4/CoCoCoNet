# OrthoCoNet User Manual

OrthoCoNet is a simple to use web server that allows the user to build and view RNA-seq coexpression networks without having to input experimental data. The data used is currated by aggregating the expression reads of RNA-seq experiments obtained through NCBI and GEMMA (?) and is thus a better representation of the average gene co-expression than any individual experiment. 

To use OrthoCoNet, simply input a list of genes to be used in the construction of the network. Given a list of genes, you can then select specific parameters which are described below, generate the results and view the distribution of co-expression values as well as the network.
